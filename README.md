SafeOps VR is a virtual reality training simulator designed to improve safety awareness among workers in modern, automated manufacturing environments. Using a photorealistic digital twin of a production factory, the project provides an interactive learning experience where users can explore, identify, and respond to potential workplace hazards without real-world risk. 2. Objectives The main goal of the project is to demonstrate how immersive VR technology can enhance occupational safety training in smart manufacturing contexts. Specific objectives include: • To simulate realistic factory safety scenarios in a virtual environment. • To help users identify common industrial hazards and apply correct safety responses. • To design a flexible platform that could be adapted for different industrial settings (e.g., electronics, automotive, or robotics assembly).
